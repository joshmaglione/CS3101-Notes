# Intro

**Goal:** To get you comfortable with basic functionality of Python to help make your life easier.

# Python

- Python, a high-level programming language, has established itself as one of the
most popular and versatile languages. 
- Python's design philosophy revolves around **easy-to-read code**.
- This readability makes Python particularly appealing for beginners and professionals alike


# Key features of Python

1. **Easy to learn and use:** Its straightforward syntax mimics natural language, allowing you to focus on learning programming concepts rather than complex syntax.
1. **Versatile:** Used in web development, data analysis, AI, scientific computing, and more.
1. **Interpreted language:** Execute code line by line in the Python interpreter, simplifying debugging and making it ideal for quick prototyping.
1. **Extensive libraries and communities:** Rich set of libraries and frameworks that simplify tasks in various domains. Large and active communities to help address needs and fix problems. 

# Vast Ecosystem of Third-Party Packages (Modules)

- Python's ecosystem includes a variety of powerful tools for different tasks.
  - **Web development:** Modules like `Django` and `Flask`.
  - **Scientific computing and data analysis:** Tools like `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `pandas`, and `Matplotlib`.
  - **Machine learning and AI:** Libraries such as `TensorFlow` and `Scikit-learn`.
- Each of these modules has a community behind it---often found on GitHub or Slack.

# Working with Python via Jupyter

- Offers an interactive environment for various programming languages, especially Python, as well as R, Julia, etc.

# How to get Jupyter

- One can install Jupyter on the machine---to do this, one needs Python.
- At least two options for free cloud-based Jupyter notebooks.
    1. [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) : Project Jupyter
    2. [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) : Google
- Binder has no strings attached, but the loadtime can be slow.
- Colab requires a Google account. Use if you want---not required!
