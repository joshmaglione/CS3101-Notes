# Exploring Python Packages on GitHub

- GitHub is a valuable resource for discovering new Python packages, and probably the *main* location to watch change happen. 
- Many projects are open-source, so get
ting a feel for how to navigate and use GitHub might help you down the line.
- Just about every Python package gets distributed on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) (or PyPI). 
- It is not easy to search on PyPI for new packages -- GitHub is much better.

We'll discuss some ways to search for Python packages or repositories more generally.

# Searching on GitHub

GitHub has a powerful search feature that allows you to find repositories containing Python packages. To search for Python packages:

- Go to the GitHub homepage.
- In the search bar, type your query followed by *`language:python`* to filter for Python repositories.
- You can further narrow down your search by using filters such as stars and topics.

Example search: *`data visualization language:python`*

# Browsing Trending Repositories

GitHub's trending repositories section is a great place to discover popular Python packages. To access trending repositories:

- Go to the GitHub homepage.
- Click on the "Explore" dropdown in the top navigation bar.
- Select "Trending" to see the most popular repositories across various languages, including Python.

# Exploring Python Topics

GitHub allows users to tag repositories with topics, making it easier to discover packages related to specific domains or technologies. To explore Python topics:

- Go to the GitHub homepage.
- Click on the "Explore" dropdown in the top navigation bar.
- Select "Topics" and then click on "Python" to see repositories tagged with the Python topic.

# Some example GitHub repos

All of the software we've used (after the \LaTeX\ discussion) exists on GitHub.

- [Python](https://github.com/python/cpython)
- [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)
- [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)
- [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [SageMath](https://github.com/sagemath/sage)

One package I want to mention given one of the themes of our module:

- [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) : Animation engine for explanatory math videos.

They have lots of examples. 

I copied their [Sine Curve Unit Circle](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/examples.html#sinecurveunitcircle) example.

Check out: 

- *`manim_code.py`*
- [SineCurveUnitCircle]()
